## This is a part of IBM's AI Engineering Professional Certificate.
## Assignment from the course specialization : Introduction to Deep learning and Neural Networks using Keras.

Assignments submitted:

A. Built a Deep learning regression model using the Keras library to build a neural network with the One hidden layer of 10 nodes, and a ReLU activation function, used adam optimizer and the mean squared error  as the loss function.

B. Built the model on the Normalized dataset with the same parameters.

C. Trained the model with 100 epochs.

D. Built the model again with 3 hidden layers and compared with the previous models.

Libraries used: Keras, Pandas, Numpy

Datasets used : Concrete.csv and MNIST dataset available in Keras.datasets
